# Chinook Digital Media Store: Visualization and Model Training in Python (3)

## Python Project Overview

Welcome to my Python Project!

This project demonstrates how I adapt the R visualization and model training project into Python for data analysis, visualization, and model training on insights from my SQL queries.
The goal is to transform raw SQL queries and extend my outputs into a clear visualization and train simple models that should support our data-driven decisions/recommendations.

## Dataset: Chinook

The database I'll be using is still the same chinook_updated.db file.
The key results we can find here will be quite similar to the R project, you can see this as an extension or adaptation of my R knowledge and Python knowledge.
I combine this Python project into only just 1 part.

* **Visualization and Model Training:** Contains connecting the database, visualization and model training for total_sales.

## Mini Games

This additional part of Python mini games allows me to explore more coding knowledge utilize it in a fun and interesting ways which I personally think it help me getting familiar with Python for example: The OOP was quite tricky for me, but I can become more aware of it now that I've created this part.
* Traffic Lights
* Bank Account Transaction
